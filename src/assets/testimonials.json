    "text": "Luca and I worked together for a couple of years and he also helped me set up two new analytics teams at Spotify. Years later both teams still benefit from the processes and culture that Luca helped us establish. Luca brought so much integrity, authenticity and empathy to the table. He is an excellent agile coach, and was committed to helping me and others to be better managers, teammates and make our jobs more meaningful and rewarding while also increasing productivity and impact. He was always very diligent in his approach and patient and generous with his time. Luca would make an excellent addition to any team."

Luca continually helped us to develop organizational structure and high level strategies, and he helped guide us through a lot of change. If pressed to try to sum up his role I would call Luca an organizational manager and a ways of working coach who also helped foster an overall culture of respect. I saw firsthand how his impact made teams more efficient and resilient, and more inclusive. Luca went above and beyond his role to help wherever needed, and he had a genuine passion and motivation for the work that was an inspiration to many around him. Overall Iâ€™d highly recommend Luca."
